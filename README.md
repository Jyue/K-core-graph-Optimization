## Description
This work is a implementation based on 2018 IEEE paper "Scalable K-Core Decomposition for Static Graphs Using a Dynamic Graph Data Structure".
## Naive Method
## Effective Method
Previously we found all vertices with degree peel = 1, and
delete them with their incident edges from G. 

Now, however, we do not delete the vertices and edges. 
Instead, when we find a vertex u, we flag u and decrement the degree of u and all
of uâ€™s neighbors. Vertices that are flagged are not considered
to be present in G, although they are not explicitly deleted.
